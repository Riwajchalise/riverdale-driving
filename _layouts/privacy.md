<p>Our Services offer you the ability to register and log in using your third-party social media account details (like your Facebook or Twitter logins). Where you choose to do this, we will receive certain profile information about you from your social media provider. The profile information we receive may vary depending on the social media provider concerned, but will often include your name, email address, friends list, and profile picture, as well as other information you choose to make public on such a social media platform.</p>
<p>We will use the information we receive only for the purposes that are described in this privacy notice or that are otherwise made clear to you on the relevant Services. Please note that we do not control, and are not responsible for, other uses of your personal information by your third-party social media provider. We recommend that you review their privacy notice to understand how they collect, use, and share your personal information, and how you can set your privacy preferences on their sites and apps.</p>
<p>5. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</p>
<p><em>In Short: **We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this privacy notice unless otherwise required by law.</em></p>
<p>We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting, or other legal requirements).</p>
<p>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</p>
<p>6. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</p>
<p><em>In Short: **We aim to protect your personal information through a system of organizational and technical security measures.</em></p>
<p>We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You should only access the Services within a secure environment.</p>

If you become aware of any data we may have collected from children under age 18, please contact us at riverdaledriving@gmail.com.</p>
<p>8. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?</p>
<p><em>In Short:**  You may review, change, or terminate your account at any time.</em></p>

You can withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us by using the contact details provided in the section &quot;<a href="http://localhost:4000/privacy-policy#contact">HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?</a>&quot; below.</p>
<p>However, please note that this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before its withdrawal nor, when applicable law allows, will it affect the processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.</p>
<p>If you have questions or comments about your privacy rights, you may email us at riverdaledriving@gmail.com.</p>
<p>9. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</p>
<p>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track (&quot;DNT&quot;) feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice.</p>
